# 🎵 Day 88 — RNN Music Generation (LSTM)

This project demonstrates how to use **LSTM-based RNNs** for **music generation**.  
It trains on synthetic musical note sequences and predicts the next note, generating new melodies.

## 🧠 Concepts
- RNNs for sequential data
- LSTM architecture
- Embedding for note representation
- Generating new sequences step-by-step

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Streamlit

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
